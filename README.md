# Estimation-Using-ML

The goal of this project is to estimate obesity levels based on physical conditions and eating 
habits using a dataset from individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. Through this project, 
various data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning 
techniques were employed to analyze health and dietary data, with the final objective of building 
a predictive model for obesity levels.
